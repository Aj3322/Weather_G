Weather G
In this project, we will be building a weather application. This application will show the temperature of a location. To fetch weather information we will need an API. An API(Application Programming Interface) is a function that allows applications to interact and share data using various components and microservices. For this project, we will be using WeatherBit API for fetching weather data. WeatherBit API provides a fast and elegant way to fetch weather data.
